Quadratic is a small Objective-C application that solves quadratic equations (ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0)
and gives you additional information about the equation.

## Features ##

+ Solves all solvable quadratic equations
+ Tells you if it is not solvable
+ Gives you the sum and product of the answers
+ Only accepts numbers
+ Choice of whether a blank input is 1 or 0.

I would greatly appreciate it if people could improve on this, as I know that it can be a useful tool and the
better it is, happier will be the people that use it and work on it.

This was the first useful app that I wrote in Objective-C, and I'm still a beginner (I mainly use Python now),
so the programming probably isn't very good. I might go through and add more comments to the code.
